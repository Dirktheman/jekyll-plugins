h1. generate_categories.rb

A generator that creates category pages for Jekyll sites (for example our "plugin category":http://recursive-design.com/blog/category/plugin/).

h2. Usage

To use it, simply drop the _generate_categories.rb_ script into the ==_plugins== directory of your Jekyll site. 

You should also copy the "category_index.html":http://recursive-design.com/code/p/jekyll-plugins/source/tree/master/layouts/category_index.html file to the <em>_layouts</em> directory of your own project. This file is provided as an example layout, and obviously you can change the HTML above as you see fit.

When you compile your Jekyll site, this plugin will loop through the list of categories in your site, and use the layout above to generate a page for each one with a list of links to the individual posts.

h2. Included filters

* *category_links* : Outputs the list of categories as comma-separated links.
* *date_to_html_string* : Outputs the post.date as formatted html, with hooks for CSS styling.

h2. Available _config.yml settings

* *category_dir* : The subfolder to build category pages in (default is 'categories').
* *category_title_prefix* : The string used before the category name in the page title (default is 'Category: ').
